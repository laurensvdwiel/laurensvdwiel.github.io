MetaDome is aimed at professionals in the (bio-)medical field of human genetics who wish to visualize the position of their mutation of interest in the context of general population-based genetic variation and provide detailed information of pathogenic variants found across homologous domain positions.

### How to access

* The MetaDome web server is [freely accessible](https://www.metadome.app) 
* The code is open-source available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cmbi/metadome)
* Raw data available at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/6625251).
