I am a [post-doctoral researcher](https://profiles.stanford.edu/lvdwiel) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). My research focuses on understanding the entire spectrum of genetic variation effects on protein function and structure to decipher molecular mechanisms of disease. Previously, I was a Ph.D. student at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/) and a Data Scientist at [FLXone](https://www.linkedin.com/company/flxone/).

I am interested in a variety of topics in Bioinformatics and Computer Science. In particular, I am interested in the application of Artificial Intelligence and Statistical Modelling to analyse human (Rare) Mendelian Disease Genetics, Evolutionary Comparative Genomics, Protein Domain Homology, and Molecular Structures.

I developed [MetaDome](https://www.metadome.app) which is further detailed [here](/software/metadome). For a comprehensive overview of my software, please have a look [here](/software).
