I am a [post-doctoral researcher](https://profiles.stanford.edu/lvdwiel) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) under supervision of [Matthew Wheeler](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/matthew-wheeler) and [Stephen Montgomery](https://profiles.stanford.edu/stephen-montgomery). My research focuses on understanding the entire spectrum of genetic variation effects on protein function and structure in order to decipher molecular mechanisms of disease. 

My post-doctoral work centers on developing novel software methodologies which combine multi-omics data to interpret the functional impact of genetic variants in undiagnosed patients. To accomplish this, I am part of the [Stanford Center for Undiagnosed Diseases](https://undiagnosed.stanford.edu/), the [GREGoR Stanford Site](https://gregor.stanford.edu/), and the [MoTrPAC Bioinformatics Center](https://motrpac-data.org/). These centers are part of the nation-wide [Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN)](https://undiagnosed.hms.harvard.edu/), the [Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare Diseases (GREGoR)](https://gregorconsortium.org/), and [The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)](https://www.motrpac.org/) respectively.

Before joining Stanford. I was received my Ph.D. at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/) in 2021 for my [Thesis - "Interpreting genomic variation using protein structures and evolutionary information"](/files/PhD_Thesis_2021_Laurens_van_de_Wiel_Interpreting_genomic_variation_using_protein_structures_and_evolutionary_information.pdf) under supervision of [Christian Gilissen](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/people/christian-gilissen), [Gert Vriend](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/vriend-g/), and [Joris Veltman](https://institute-genetics-cancer.ed.ac.uk/research/research-groups-a-z/veltman-group). I was a Data Scientist at [FLXone](https://www.linkedin.com/company/flxone/), where I developed machine learning solutions within a large-scale, real-time infrastructure. I obtained my MSc degree from [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/) in 2014 for my [Thesis - "Differentiating Shigella from E. coli using hierarchical feature selection on MALDI-TOF MS Data"](/files/MSc_Thesis_2014_Laurens_van_de_wiel_Differentiating_Shigella_from_E_coli_using_hierarchical_feature_selection_on_MALDI-TOF_MS_Data.pdf) under supervision of [Tom Heskes](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~tomh/), [Evgeni Levin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evgeni-levin-phd-747a14a0), and [Armand Paauw](https://www.linkedin.com/in/armand-paauw-04105510).

Some of my work has been featured in the media, see [here](/media).

Research
======

I am interested in a variety of topics in Bioinformatics and Computer Science. In particular, I am interested in the application of Artificial Intelligence and Statistical Modelling to analyse human (Rare) Mendelian Disease Genetics, Evolutionary Comparative Genomics, Protein Domain Homology, and Molecular Structures.
